  <h1>Beginner's Guide to Forex Trading</h1>
  <p>Welcome to KillZone FX’s comprehensive beginner guide. This page will help you understand the forex market, trading sessions, strategies, and tips for getting started safely and effectively.</p>

  <h2>Introduction to Forex Trading</h2>
  <p>Forex, short for <strong>foreign exchange</strong>, is the global market where currencies are traded. It is the largest financial market in the world, with trillions of dollars traded daily. Unlike stocks, the forex market operates <strong>24 hours a day, five days a week</strong>, allowing traders around the world to participate anytime.</p>
  <p>Forex trading involves buying one currency while simultaneously selling another. Currencies are always quoted in pairs like <strong>EUR/USD</strong> or <strong>GBP/JPY</strong>. The first currency is the <strong>base currency</strong>, and the second is the <strong>quote currency</strong>. Example: If EUR/USD = 1.1000, it means 1 Euro = 1.10 US Dollars.</p>

  <h2>Why Trade Forex?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> Forex is extremely liquid, so trades can be executed quickly without affecting the price much.</li>
    <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> The market is open 24/5, allowing trading at your convenience.</li>
    <li><strong>Leverage:</strong> Brokers offer leverage, letting traders control larger positions with smaller capital.</li>
    <li><strong>Diversity:</strong> Trade major, minor, exotic currency pairs, commodities, indices, or crypto depending on your broker.</li>
    <li><strong>Opportunities in any market condition:</strong> Profit in both rising and falling markets.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Understanding Forex Sessions</h2>
  <p>The forex market is divided into four main trading sessions, corresponding to the largest financial centers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sydney Session:</strong> Starts the trading week, lower volatility, best for AUD/NZD pairs.</li>
    <li><strong>Tokyo Session:</strong> Major Asian currencies active, moderate volatility, good for cautious traders.</li>
    <li><strong>London Session:</strong> High volatility and liquidity, overlaps with Tokyo and New York create <strong>KillZones</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>New York Session:</strong> Major USD activity, high volatility, especially during London overlap.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>KillZone / Overlaps:</strong> When two sessions overlap, the market experiences higher liquidity and tighter spreads, offering prime trading opportunities.</p>

  <h2>Basic Forex Concepts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pips:</strong> Smallest unit of price movement. Example: EUR/USD moves 1.1000 → 1.1005 = 5 pips.</li>
    <li><strong>Lots:</strong> Standardized trade sizes. Standard lot = 100,000, Mini = 10,000, Micro = 1,000.</li>
    <li><strong>Spread:</strong> Difference between buy (ask) and sell (bid) price.</li>
    <li><strong>Leverage & Margin:</strong> Trade positions larger than your capital, e.g., 1:100 leverage. Use cautiously.</li>
    <li><strong>Long vs Short:</strong> Going long = buy expecting price rise, going short = sell expecting price fall.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Types of Forex Analysis</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fundamental Analysis:</strong> Study economic news, interest rates, and geopolitical events.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical Analysis:</strong> Use charts and indicators like RSI, MACD, Moving Averages.</li>
    <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> Analyze market mood using COT reports and retail positioning.</li>
  </ul>

    <li><strong>Develop a Trading Strategy:</strong> Decide scalping, day trading, or swing trading approach.</li>
