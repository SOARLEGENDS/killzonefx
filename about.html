<h1>About KillZone</h1>

<p>
KillZone is a lightweight, real-time forex session tracker designed for traders
who want clarity — not confusion.
</p>

<p>
We focus on showing <strong>accurate market sessions</strong>, automatic
<strong>daylight saving time (DST) adjustments</strong>, and clear
<strong>liquidity overlaps</strong> without bloated indicators or broker bias.
</p>

<p>
KillZone does not provide trading signals or financial advice. It is built purely
to help traders understand <em>when</em> the market is active — not <em>what</em>
to trade.
</p>

<p>
Built for speed. Built for accuracy. Built by traders.
